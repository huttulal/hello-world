# hello-world
Hello world assignment 1 for OSU's CS361 course to get used to GitHub.

I am a 22 year old CS student at OSU. This is my first term here and my 5th year in school. I origionally went to U of O out of high school, and two years later I went to PSU. Two years after that and now I'm here at OSU! I'm excited to get my degree here once and for all! Some of my hobbies include dancing, skiing, singing, fountain pens, videogames, and livestreaming.
